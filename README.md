# Aircraft Routing: the Travelling Salesman Problem
In the aviation industry, the routing of airplanes between airports to optimize for some combination
of common constraints (distance, fuel expenditure, et cetera) is of readily apparent interest. 
This can be understood as an instance of the 
[Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), for 
which there is no known (exact) classical algorithmic solution with a runtime better than $O(2^n)$.
As such, a variety of approaches can be found in the literature that attempt a general solution,
and which algorithm is employed may vary based on user needs.

In light of these facts, this project is an attempt to provide a user friendly graphical interface that facilitates:
1. Uploading, validating, and conditional processing of user provided
[Comma Separated Value](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) data.
1. User visualization of a graphical representation of the user provided data as well as the optimal paths generated by various algorithmic approaches.
1. Creating rich, interactive, and scaleable image files of the user provided data points and the optimal path generated by a user selected algorithm.
