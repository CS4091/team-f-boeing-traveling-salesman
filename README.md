# Aircraft Routing: the Travelling Salesman Problem
In the aviation industry, the routing of planes between airports to optimize for some combination 
of common constraints (distance, fuel expenditure, et cetera) is of readily apparent interest. 
This can be understood as an instance of the 
[Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), for 
which there is no know (exact) classical algorithmic solution with a runtime better than $O(2^n)$.

This project is an attempt to provide a user friendly graphical interface that facilitates:
1. Uploading, validating, and conditional processing of user provided [Comma Separated Value](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) data.
1. User visualization of a graphical representation of the user provided data as well as the optimal paths generated by various algorithmic approaches.
1. Creating rich, interactive, and scaleable image files of the user provided data points and the optimal path generated by a user selected algorithm.
